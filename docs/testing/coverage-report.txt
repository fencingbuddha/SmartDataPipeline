Generated from pytest with coverage plugin
Python 3.14 • 144 tests • 38.84 seconds

## 1. Executive Summary
The test suite achieved 84.14% total coverage, exceeding the required 80%. A total of 144 automated tests executed successfully with zero failures. This includes unit, integration, system, and user acceptance tests.

## 2. Coverage Overview
TOTAL STATEMENTS: 2029
MISSED STATEMENTS: 262
TOTAL BRANCHES: 500
PARTIAL BRANCHES: 91
OVERALL COVERAGE: 84.14%

High‑coverage areas include ingestion, forecasting services, metrics calculators, and all database models. Security middleware and cryptography utilities also demonstrate near‑complete coverage.

## 3. Moderately Covered Areas (70–89%)
Routers such as forecast.py, metrics.py, anomaly_iforest.py, and ingest.py have moderate coverage due to complex validation and exception paths. These reflect realistic runtime variations and are considered acceptable for the MVP.

## 4. Low‑Coverage Areas (<50%)
app/db.py (0%) is deprecated and unused. scheduler/jobs.py remains difficult to test due to APScheduler internals, though critical behavior is validated by scheduler smoke tests.

## 5. Explanation of Missing Lines
Uncovered lines correspond to rare error handling paths, dependency‑failure fallbacks, dead code scheduled for removal, or APScheduler branches that would require extensive mocking.

## 6. Test Categories
- Unit tests: analytics, ETL, reliability scoring, crypto utilities.
- Integration tests: raw ingestion → clean events → metrics pipeline.
- UAT tests: ingestion, KPIs, forecasting contracts, anomaly overlays, auth flows.
- Security tests: headers, JWT expiry, refresh logic.

## 7. Compliance Statement
The Smart Data Pipeline project meets and exceeds all course requirements for test coverage. At 84.14%, the system is well‑validated and stable for its MVP release.

## 8. Post‑MVP Enhancements
Future work may improve coverage for APScheduler paths, extend ingestion failure tests, and refine reliability scoring branch coverage.
