PIP AUDIT REPORT — SmartDataPipeline
Generated for QR‑4 Security Verification

Run Command:
    pip-audit --strict --desc --progress-spinner=off

Environment:
    Python Version: 3.14.0
    Platform: macOS (ARM64)
    Virtual Environment: backend/.venv

Summary:
    The most recent pip-audit run reported 1 known vulnerability in a transitive
    dependency (Starlette), with all other packages passing vulnerability checks
    at the time of the audit.

Findings:
    • Package: starlette
      - Installed version: 0.48.0
      - Advisory ID: GHSA-7f5h-v6xp-fcq8
      - Description: Denial-of-service risk via quadratic-time processing of
        crafted HTTP Range headers in FileResponse/StaticFiles.
      - Fix version: 0.49.1

Risk Assessment:
    • SmartDataPipeline does not expose general-purpose static file serving for
      untrusted users. The backend primarily serves JSON APIs for a trusted React
      frontend.
    • FileResponse/StaticFiles endpoints are not part of ingestion, KPI,
      anomaly, forecasting, or scheduler flows.
    • Exploitation would require the ability to send crafted Range headers
      repeatedly to a file-serving endpoint, which is not present in the demo
      deployment model.
    • Immediate upgrade is constrained by FastAPI's current Starlette pin.

Mitigation & Plan:
    • Short term (Capstone scope):
      - Document the vulnerability and constraints in QR‑4 / AR‑5 materials.
      - Treat as a low‑likelihood, low‑impact risk for the academic demo.
      - Avoid creating new public-facing StaticFiles/FileResponse endpoints.
    • Long term (Post‑project hardening):
      - Upgrade FastAPI to a version compatible with Starlette ≥ 0.49.1.
      - Re-run pytest, coverage, and pip-audit after upgrades.
      - Record any new CVEs, severities, and remediation steps in this file.

Breakdown (current run):
    Total dependencies scanned: 97
    Vulnerabilities found: 1
    Vulnerabilities fixed: 0 (framework pin prevents immediate bump)
    Vulnerabilities ignored: 0

Status:
    ATTENTION — Known DoS vulnerability in starlette 0.48.0 documented and
    accepted as a constrained risk for the capstone demo, with a clear
    remediation path once framework constraints are lifted.
